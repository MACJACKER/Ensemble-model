# Ensemble-model
Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an advanced ensemble model in R Studio, integrating a variety of machine learning techniques for predictive analytics. The primary goal was to improve prediction accuracy by combining models such as ridge regression, lasso, logistic regression, linear regression, and random forest. We also implemented bagging and elastic net approaches to refine our predictions further.

Objectives
To combine multiple predictive models into a single robust ensemble model to leverage the strengths of various approaches.
To utilize bagging and elastic net modeling to reduce variance and optimize the prediction accuracy of our ensemble model.
To demonstrate the application of ensemble learning in handling complex predictive tasks with higher accuracy than individual models.

Models Used
Ridge Regression: Addresses multicollinearity, reduces model complexity, and prevents overfitting.
Lasso Regression: Performs variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy.
Logistic Regression: Used for predicting binary outcomes, beneficial in classification tasks.
Linear Regression: Provides a foundation for understanding relationships between variables.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and control over-fitting.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Standardized the data to ensure that the model inputs were normalized, facilitating effective learning.
Model Development: Each model was developed individually and assessed for performance.
Bagging and Elastic Net Implementation: Integrated bagging techniques and applied elastic net modeling to combine the benefits of both ridge and lasso regression.
Ensemble Creation: Combined all individual models using a model averaging approach to form the final ensemble model.

Tools and Technologies
R Studio: All development was done in R Studio, utilizing various packages such as caret, glmnet, randomForest, and e1071.
Git: Used for version control to manage and track the progress of the project development.
